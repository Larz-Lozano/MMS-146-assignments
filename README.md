python codes assignments for MMS 146 

**ASSIGNMENT 2**
Submit a Python code (called SurnameStudent1_SurnameStudent2.py) that subscribes to the ff. instructions. 

* Choose 5 real-world objects from what you've proposed in Assignment #1.
* Convert them into actual Python classes, complete with the attributes and methods. 
* You may add/subtract/modify the attributes or methods if this aids your implementation, as long as there are at least 5 attributes and 5 methods (minimum requirement) PER CLASS.
* The body of the methods should not be empty. It's up to you how you will implement it creatively. It doesn't have to be complicated as long as it makes sense. I will also grade you based on the logic of your methods. In other words, everything has to make sense.
* Do not forget to properly document your codes.
* As previously mentioned, you will submit only one Python code which contains several classes (i.e. your 5 classes) and the main program. This is an example.
* I will grant bonus points to those who will convert ALL 8 real-world objects.
* Take note that, again, only 1 submission has to be made per pair.
